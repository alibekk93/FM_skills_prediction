**Predicting player Football Manager skills using real statistics**

## Applications
Soccer statistics is a lot of fun, but sometimes may be overwhelming. For somebody like myself, a person who spent way too much time on Football Manager in childhood (and adulthood), it is much easier to assess those amazing tables with numbers in 1-20 range. Moreover, these numbers could be conveniently transformed into radar graphs. Oh, these radar graphs. I had them in my dreams, both nightmares and some, well, more pleasant ones. It would also be a lot of fun to see if the numbers can be transformed into atrificial ones!
